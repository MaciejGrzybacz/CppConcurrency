# Introduction 

This repository contains the code for the first lab of the Theory of Concurrency course. 
It is a simple C++ program that demonstrates the use of threads and synchronization.

## Exercises

1. Please implement the `Counter` class and two threads: one incrementing
   and one decrementing the shared counter.
2. Please test the program (time, result) with and without synchronization.
3. Please check how many threads can be created in the system.
